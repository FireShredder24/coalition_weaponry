		Coalition Weapons Pack
			Version 1.2.1
					Author:
			FireShredder24
------------------------------
This mod was *NOT* designed to be balanced with vanilla, so any vanilla ship confronting any Coalition vessel of greater class than a frigate is most likely toast.  A Mediator-class SD will take on 3 Imperial-class star destroyers with ease, destroying two and maiming the third as the Mediator's extremely thick armor belt is finally broken.  Note that the example ships also use the WWII mod, another mod created by FireShredder24.
------------------------------
This mod was designed to be used with the WWII mod, essentially a World War II-themed add-on to the CWP that can stand alone.  Therefore, the ships in the "Example Ships" folder also use the WWII mod in addition to the CWP.  The CWP's lack of a roof turreted high-DPS cannon are remedied by the 5-inch gun of WWII, and WWII's lack of a compact power source is made good by the CWP's colar panel.

***********DEBUG**************
Known issues:
 - When used with SW mod, crash when Shift+Del is used on multiple ships
 - Prior to Cosmoteer 0.13.7, crew sitting in CIWS do not move correctly with the turret
 - Sometimes railgun slugs will fly in wierd directions when fired through thick ships
 - Wireless charging ports partially charge each other
 - Version 1.1 has compatibility issue with 0.13.6 where a part has the [OtherIDs = "aux_cockpit"] tag, which is recognized by post-0.13.6 versions of Cosmoteer as unique, thus causing a duplicate part ID error
