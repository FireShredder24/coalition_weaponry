Most of the capital ships in this folder require the WWII mod as well as the CWP.  The WWII mod is also made by me and *might* be included later in a
modpack that contains both it and the CWP.

Full list of the ships that require the WWII mod as well:
Avenger-class battlecruiser
Chieftain-class heavy cruiser
Falcon-class cruiser
Hyena-class escort
Mediator-class star destroyer

Note: The CWP was not designed to be balanced with vanilla.  The ships in this folder, especially the Mediator-class, will absolutely wipe the floor
with ships from most other mods, including SW mod Imperial-I class Star Destroyers and Venator-class cruisers.
